# OpenApi React Ts App

This is a simple application that demonstrates how to use OpenAPI to generate types and components. Also, it uses `antd` for the UI components, `storybook` for the component library, and `jest` for testing.

For the architecture, I've used `atomic design` principles to organize the components.
